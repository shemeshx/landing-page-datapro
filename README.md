Hey, My name is Idan Shemesh.\
Glad you are viewing my landing page.

Few things to know :
- For client side I used React (with some addons).
- For server side I used NodeJS (Express).
- I stored the information in JSON file.

To access the admin page please go to - 'http://localhost:COSTUME_PORT/admin'
For login please enter for user and password - 'admin'. (other users won't work)
For the landing page please go to - 'http://localhost:COSTUME_PORT'

In the landing page you must enter all information needed to continue.
The admin page contain 2 things - Chart and Table.
In order to change values in the table just double click it, and edit. It will save in the JSON file immediately.

Thanks!
